# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who participates in our project and community. We pledge to create a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

To foster a positive and respectful environment, we expect the following behaviors from all participants:

- Use inclusive and welcoming language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Prioritize the best interests of the community.
- Show empathy towards fellow community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, as well as unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Engaging in trolling, making derogatory comments, or launching personal or political attacks.
- Harassing individuals in public or private settings.
- Sharing others' private information without explicit permission, such as physical or electronic addresses.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of behavior. We are committed to taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and public spaces where individuals represent the project or its community. This includes using official project e-mail addresses, posting through official social media accounts, or acting as appointed representatives at online or offline events. Project maintainers may further define and clarify the representation of a project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at [anuchit.boonsom@gmail.com](mailto:anuchit.boonsom@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Additional details about specific enforcement policies may be provided separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
